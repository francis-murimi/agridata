The opportunities in Cassava farming cannot be overstated. Farm Crowdy reports that at least 1 in 10 families all over the world consumes products made from cassava daily. Cassava, now grown throughout the tropical world, is second only to the sweet potato as the most important starchy root crop of the tropics.

The areas now used for cassava cultivation are increasing rapidly because it grows easily, has large yields and is little affected by diseases and pests. The plant is grown for its edible tubers, which serve as a staple food in many tropical countries and are also the source of an important starch.

Why is this farm product in high demand? Well, here are some of the benefits:

With all these benefits in mind, let’s examine the steps required to start a profitable cassava enterprise.

On soil with depleted nutrient, fertilizers should be applied 8 weeks after planting and should be applied 6cm in width and 10cm from the cassava plant. Also, make sure the fertilizer does not touch the stem or leaves.

There you have it. If the above practices are followed to the latter, the yield can be up to 25 tons per hectare and up to 60 ton/ha for hybrid varieties. With this, you can tap into a thriving market!
